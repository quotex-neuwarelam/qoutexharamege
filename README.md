## Is Quotex Haram or Halal? {#"is-quotex-haram-or-halal"}

The question of whether Quotex is haram or halal has been a topic of
debate among Muslim traders. Some scholars consider binary options
trading to be haram due to its gambling-like nature. However, Quotex
offers a variety of trading instruments that are not considered
gambling, such as CFDs (Contracts for Difference).

According to the [Darul
Iftaa](\%22https://www.daruliftaa.net/node/1709\%22), CFDs are halal as
long as they are based on real underlying assets and are not used for
excessive speculation or gambling.
